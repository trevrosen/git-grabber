					<h4>"dark-matter developers"</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>writing the software that quietly runs the world</li>
						<li>don't go to cons, read HackerNews</li>
						<li>never working on the latest, coolest stuff</li>

						A language like Go should be trying to get more of these people

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Almost all of us are dark matter devs at one time or another</li>
								<li>much of the time, only the downstream product matters - our code just enables it</li>

					It's easy to be stuck
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>People naturally fear change - especially software orgs.</li>
							<li>But they also want to move forward. Just as soon as...</li>

					Go is perfect for these people (and for you)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Go proves you don't need to use old tech</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>An official Google language</li>
						<li>Containerized ops revolution does wonders for cred</li>
						<li>"batteries included" massive stdlib keeps deps count low</li>
						<li>static bins maximize deployability and options for porting</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hanselman talks about people using "10-year-old" tech, but Go is perfectly (uniquely?) suited to jump that timeline

					<h2>Places Go shines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>small network services</li>
						<li>command line tools</li>
						<li>one-off solutions for customers</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					So take some inspiration from the dark matter devs quietly getting tons done.
					Resolve to put something into production with Go in 2017.

						<h3>Pick a port, (not) any port</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						What makes for a good porting candidate?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Small enough to take on solo</li>
							<li>Important enough that people care</li>
							<li>Not too high-visibility </li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>You don't want to have to get a co-worker involved unless you've already got a partner</li>
								<li>You want to work on this at work - not just on spec</li>
								<li>You don't want too many people breathing down your neck - no one loves a committee</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Permission</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>get it</li>
							<li>from the right person</li>
							<li>not from every person</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>don't go rogue - businesses hate that</li>
								<li>don't go look for everyone to say yes first - identify the minimal number of stakeholders that let you do it responsibly</li>
								<li>make sure someone important is in favor of what you're doing - you'll need an advocate later</li>
								<li>Remember that you're on the clock - someone is gambling on you. Respect that. Commit to delivery.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Nip FUD in the Bud</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt can cause a port project to die a death by a thousand cuts</li>
							<li>Data is FUD's mortal enemy - get some</li>
							<li>People fear what they don't understand - instrument your port with NewRelic, Sentry, and the like</li>
							<li>Make a plan to make this real software from day one</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You'll hear a million times "oh new problem X must be because of the port". You need to be ready to constantly beat that back.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Quick Real-world tale: my own port
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Authentication/authorization service for a rapidly monoservice-ifying environment</li>
							<li>Port from a Rails app which was first attempt at extracting security functionality</li>
							<li>Many random warts that needed to be accomodated</li>
							<li>Port took about 6 weeks, much of which was my own learning curve climb</li>
							<li>Work paid for my learn-facepalm-refactor cycle</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Result?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Serves ~1.5 million requests per day</li>
							<li>Mean: 22ms</li>
							<li>Median: 7ms</li>
							<li>99p: 95ms</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Good enough for now. No attempt to optimize these numbers
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						How's the buisness feel about this?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>According to ops, this is our most highly-trafficked service</li>
							<li>Also our most reliable service</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						We now have two other Go-based services in production or pre-production, as well as a wealth of internal tools.
					</section>

					<section>
						With the next released service (April), Go will be an officially adopted tech.
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Key Findings</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						(Conclusions I came to so that you don't have to!)
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Opinionated frameworks save time on greenfield projects, suck time on ports</li>
							<li>Stay away from "magic"</li>
							<li>Some community guidelines are useful, some are not.</li>
							<li>Be ready to lack things you love from $FAVORITE_FRAMEWORK</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Don't try to port something using something like Goa - making your old thing adapt to the framework is a useless time suck</li>
								<li>You'll be learning a lot here, so take the time to learn the moving parts - it pays off later</li>
								<li>Example: "use libs that work well with standard library" (good advice). "Never use any testing stuff but stdlib's testing package" (dogma)</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>One Man's Stack</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					First a note on your new best friends
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com">Postman</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/">Make</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/stedolan/jq">#</a>jq</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Postman is an incredible tool for building up an HTTP API with external calls</li>
							<li>You'll miss the booted "environment" of your app of you're coming from Rails, Django, or Express</li>
							<li>A Makefile is key to wrangling all the little tasks around your project</li>
							<li>jq lets you easily deal with JSON-based config files from inside Make or shell</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Opinions on testing</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						Use native testing package as much as possible
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Tests run crazy fast</li>
							<li>Lots of useful features and idioms for free</li>
							<li>Use for handlers, helpers, middleware, sub-package testing</li>
							<li>Don't use for DB unit tests</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You'll want a real DB in place for your DB method unit tests. Having a test runner framework that helps with that is key. I find this division useful, simple, robust.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Have discreet interfaces that implement DB functions, and use Ginkgo to test them.
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Interfaces are easy to stub in integration tests</li>
							<li>Helps keep separation of concerns neat</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Why Ginkgo?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>I've found that BDD-style frameworks are really nice for DB tests</li>
							<li>Fine-grained setup/teardown hooks make setting up object graphs a cinch</li>
							<li>Hooks let you guarantee state of your database</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lots of your application's functionality is likely to be transactional database stuff. You need to keep that complex query under test against a real schema? Just use Ginkgo.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>The Rest of the Stack</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						URL multiplexing and routing with Gorilla Mux
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Organize your routes into logical groupings</li>
							<li>Deconstruct URLs into variables/values</li>
							<li>Match on HTTP methods, path prefixes, more</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							There are a lot of routers out there. Gorilla is a great one and it plays well with lots of other things.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Gorm for ORM stuff
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>ORMs aren't for everything. Just for lots of things.</li>
							<li>Powerful, chainable scoping behavior</li>
							<li>Active Record pattern</li>
							<li>Tag-based field customizations for indices, etc</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							I find ORM hate naive and have no time for it. The vast majority of your DB interactions in a transactional web application are simple interactions between business logic objects.
						</aside>
					</section>

						<section>
							Negroni for middleware
						</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Super-simple middleware management</li>
							<li>Nice OOB functionality with panic catcher and basic logging</li>
							<li>Very easy middleware pattern plays nice with native HTTP stuff</li>
							<li>Hooks for pre and post handler processing</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Viper for configuration
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Extremely configurable</li>
							<li>In wide usage in a number of prominent Go projects</li>
							<li>Powerful feature set includes things like wathching remote services (etcd, Consul) for config changes</li>
							<li>Intelligent precedence and flag usage</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Logrus for logging
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Drop-in replacement for stdlig's log package</li>
							<li>Runtime-configurable formatting makes logging easy to consume either as a dev or in prod</li>
							<li>3rd-party hooks for almost any exception service you can name</li>
							<li>API encourages structured logging</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							If you're making services, you owe it to yourself to settle on a simple pattern for structured logging. Logrus helps with that.
