				<section>
					Sorry, Marc - not all of it is the new hotness
				</section>

				<section>
					There are tons of small services and CLI tools out there. Chances are, you've written them.
					<aside class="notes">
						People in this room are writing the software that's eating the world, b/c what this means is that it's all over the place, it's involved in everything.
					</aside>

					THAT for better or worse is the stuff "eating the world" - just the workaday software that runs everything.

					<h4>"dark-matter developers"</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>don't go to cons, read HackerNews</li>
						<li>never working on the latest, coolest stuff</li>
						<li>writing the software that people rely on without knowing it</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						There's even a name for this, coined by Scott Hansleman.
					</aside>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Sound familiar?</li>
								<li>Almost all of us are dark matter devs at one time or another</li>
								<li>much of the time, only the downstream product matters - our code just enables it</li>
								<li>A language like Go should be trying to get more of these people</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>

				<section>
					Maybe you're here because you want to use Go but don't know where to start
				</section>

				<section>
					It's easy to get stuck at the permission/implementation phase
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>People naturally fear change - especially software orgs.</li>
							<li>business constraints often seem at odds with the idea of porting something</li>
							<li>But they also want to move forward. Just as soon as...</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					But Go is perfect for these "dark matter" people - and for you
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Go proves you don't need to use old tech</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>An official Google language</li>
						<li>Containerized ops revolution brings major cred</li>
						<li>awesome stdlib keeps deps count low</li>
						<li>static bins maximize deployability</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hanselman talks about people using "10-year-old" tech, but Go is perfectly (uniquely?) suited to jump that timeline
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Places Go shines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>small network services</li>
						<li>command line tools</li>
						<li>one-off solutions for customers</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Internal CLI tool, small web service, or custom network scanner -- all awesome for Go
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					So take some inspiration from the dark matter devs quietly getting tons done.
					Resolve to put something into production with Go in 2017.

						<h3>Pick a port, (not) any port</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						What makes for a good porting candidate?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Small enough to take on solo</li>
							<li>Important enough that people care</li>
							<li>Not too high-visibility </li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>You don't want to have to get a co-worker involved unless you've already got a partner</li>
								<li>You want to work on this at work - not just on spec</li>
								<li>You don't want too many people breathing down your neck - no one loves a committee</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Permission</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>get it</li>
							<li>from the right person</li>
							<li>not from every person</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>don't go rogue - businesses hate that</li>
								<li>don't go look for everyone to say yes first - identify the minimal number of stakeholders that let you do it responsibly</li>
								<li>make sure someone important is in favor of what you're doing - you'll need an advocate later</li>
								<li>Remember that you're on the clock - someone is gambling on you. Respect that. Commit to delivery.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Nip FUD in the Bud</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt can cause a port project to die a death by a thousand cuts</li>
							<li>Data is FUD's mortal enemy</li>
							<li>Instrument your port with NewRelic, Sentry, etc</li>
							<li>Plan to make *real software* from day one</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You'll hear a million times "oh new problem X must be because of the port". You need to be ready to constantly beat that back.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Quick Real-world tale: my own port
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Auth service for a rapidly de-mono-ifying stack</li>
							<li>Port from a Rails app</li>
							<li>Many random warts</li>
							<li>Port took about 6 weeks (mostly learning curve)</li>
							<li>Work paid for my learn-facepalm-refactor cycle</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Result?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Serves ~1.5 million requests per day</li>
							<li>Mean: 22ms</li>
							<li>Median: 7ms</li>
							<li>99p: 95ms</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Good enough for now. No attempt to optimize these numbers
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						How's the buisness feel about this?
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>According to Ops Data</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>It is our most highly-trafficked service</li>
							<li>It is also our most reliable service</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Huge win for Go in the org!
					</section>

					<section>
						We now have two other Go-based services in production or pre-production, as well as an ever-growing collection of internal tools.
					</section>

					<section>
						With the next released service (April), Go will be an officially adopted tech.
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Key Findings</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						(Conclusions I came to so that you don't have to!)
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Opinionated frameworks suck time on ports</li>
							<li>Stay away from "magic"</li>
							<li>Some recieved wisdom is useful, some isn't</li>
							<li>Don't try to recreate $FAVORITE_FRAMEWORK</li>
							<li>Embrace the learning journey</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Don't try to port something using something like Goa - making your old thing adapt to the framework is a useless time suck. Great for greenfields tho!</li>
								<li>You'll be learning a lot here, so take the time to learn the moving parts - it pays off later</li>
								<li>Example: "use libs that work well with standard library" (good advice). "Never use any testing stuff but stdlib's testing package" (dogma)</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>One Man's Stack</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					First a note on your new best friends
					<aside class="notes">
						The static bin thing means you have to do some things differently than you might in Python/Ruby/Node.
						This mostly means writing a little extra stuff around your app and learning some new tools.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com">Postman</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/">Make</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/stedolan/jq">jq</a></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Postman for building up an HTTP API with external calls, sharing w/ team</li>
							<li>A Makefile is key to wrangling all the little tasks around your project</li>
							<li>jq lets you easily deal with JSON-based config files from inside Make or shell</li>
						</ul>

					<section>
					<h2>Opinions on testing</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						Use native testing package as much as possible
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Tests run crazy fast</li>
							<li>Lots of useful features and idioms for free</li>
							<li>Use for handlers, helpers, middleware, etc</li>
							<li><em>Don't</em> use for DB unit tests</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							You'll want a real DB in place for your DB method unit tests. Having a test runner framework that helps with that is key. I find this division useful, simple, robust.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Have discreet interfaces that represent your DB functionality, and use Ginkgo to test their concrete implementations.
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Interfaces are easy to stub in integration tests</li>
							<li>Helps keep separation of concerns neat</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>How a mock interface works</p>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim>
type MockSdb struct {
	OnFindGitHubUserByName func(string) (*GitHubUser, error)
	OnSaveRecord           func(interface{}) error
}

func (mdb *MockSdb) FindGitHubUserByName(name string) (*GitHubUser, error) {
	return mdb.OnFindGitHubUserByName(name)
}

func (mdb *MockSdb) SaveRecord(record interface{}) error {
	return mdb.OnSaveRecord(record)
}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>

					<section>
						Why Ginkgo?
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>BDD-style frameworks are really nice for logic/setup-filled DB tests</li>
							<li>Fine-grained setup/teardown hooks make setting up object graphs a cinch</li>
							<li>Hooks let you guarantee state of your database</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Lots of your application's functionality is likely to be transactional database stuff. You need to keep that complex query under test against a real schema? Just use Ginkgo.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>The Rest of the Stack</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						Gorilla Mux for URL multiplexing and routing
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Organize your routes into logical groupings</li>
							<li>Deconstruct URLs into variables/values</li>
							<li>Match on HTTP methods, path prefixes, more</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							There are a lot of routers out there. Gorilla is a great one and it plays well with lots of other things.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Gorm for ORM stuff
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>ORMs aren't for everything. Just for lots of things.</li>
							<li>Powerful, chainable scoping behavior</li>
							<li>Active Record pattern</li>
							<li>Tag-based field customizations for indices, etc</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							I find absolutist ORM hate naive and have no time for it. The vast majority of your DB interactions in a transactional web application are simple interactions between business logic objects.
						</aside>
					</section>

						<section>
							Negroni for middleware
						</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Super-simple middleware management</li>
							<li>Catches panics, does basic logging</li>
							<li>Middleware pattern plays nice with native</li>
							<li>Hooks for pre and post handler processing</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Viper for configuration
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Extremely flexible</li>
							<li>Used in a number of prominent Go projects</li>
							<li>Powerful feature set</li>
							<li>Intelligent precedence and flag usage</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Can do things like watch keys in remote stores (etcd or Consul) for config changes
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						Logrus for logging
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Drop-in replacement for stdlib's log package</li>
							<li>Runtime-configurable formatting</li>
							<li>3rd-party hooks for exception services</li>
							<li>API encourages structured logging</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							If you're making services, you owe it to yourself to settle on a simple pattern for structured logging. Logrus helps with that.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					This is just the stack that I've decided I like for *ports*
					<aside class="notes">
						If I were starting a general purpose web app from scratch today, I'd try Buffalo.
						When I've worked on API applications in Go, I've used Goa
						This stack gives you maximum flexibility. You pay for that with lengthier code, etc.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					Obviously your own mileage may vary.
				</section>

				<section>
					Are there things that we could do better? Yes.
				</section>

				<section>
					But if our code keeps doing the right thing and failing to drive us nuts, that's a win.
				</section>

				<section>
					So get strategic, get permission, evangelize to the right people...
				</section>

				<section>
					...and put something Go-powered into production this year!
